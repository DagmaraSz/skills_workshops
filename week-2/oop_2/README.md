> Separate Out the Things That Change from Those That Stay the Same
> â€“ Russ Olsen, Design Patterns in Ruby

This workshop introduces you to the idea of separating the things that change from the things that stay the same.

### Instructions

There are two projects here: both print out a string in a variety of different ways. One of them (`/great`) is written well, following the principle above. One of them (`/terrible`) is written poorly, ignoring the principle above.

Both programs use the same user interface. The following user stories **have already been implemented for you**:

```
As a user
So I can read in any environment
I want to convert strings to different output types (text, html, json, and xml)
```

```
As a user
So I can avoid typos
I want to raise an error if I input an unrecognised type
```

Given that users will interact with the program via `irb`, your job is to implement the following features. **Implement them first in `/terrible`, then in `/great`, and compare the experiences of developing in each.**

**You must use the idioms and styles of the program you have been given.**

```
As a user
So I can be shouty
I want to be able to upcase all my outputs
```

```
As a user
So I can save space
I want to convert any instances of the word "Example" to "e.g."
```
